## Overview

This article compares four major multi-agent framework SDKs, evaluating their strengths and use cases for building collaborative AI systems.

## Frameworks Compared

### 1. LangChain
- **GitHub Stars**: 110k+
- **Strengths**: 
  - Flexible and wide model support
  - Large community and ecosystem
  - Extensive documentation
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Requires manual multi-agent coordination
  - More complex setup for multi-agent scenarios
- **Best For**: Startups or solo projects requiring flexibility

### 2. CrewAI
- **Purpose**: Built specifically for multi-agent systems
- **Strengths**:
  - Simplifies agent collaboration
  - Purpose-built for team coordination
  - Enterprise adoption (Oracle, Deloitte)
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - Less flexible than general-purpose frameworks
- **Best For**: Enterprise multi-agent workflows

### 3. OpenAI Agent SDK
- **Integration**: Tightly integrated with OpenAI APIs
- **Strengths**:
  - Quick prototyping with OpenAI models
  - Native tool calling support
  - Sleek and fast implementation
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Limited to OpenAI ecosystem
- **Best For**: Rapid prototyping with OpenAI models

### 4. Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Launch Date**: April 2025
- **Strengths**:
  - Native Gemini model integration
  - Built-in handoff system
  - Google Cloud integration
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Newer framework, less mature
  - Google ecosystem lock-in
- **Best For**: Google Cloud users and Gemini model deployments

## Comparison Criteria

1. **Ease of Use**: How quickly can developers get started?
2. **Model Support**: Which LLMs are supported?
3. **Agent Collaboration**: How well do agents work together?
4. **Scalability**: Can it handle enterprise workloads?

## Example Scenario

The article uses a school system example with:
- Three teaching agents (Math, Science, History)
- One Principal agent for coordination
- All using Gemini 2.0 Flash model

## Key Insights

- **No One-Size-Fits-All**: The "winner" depends on specific project needs
- **LangChain**: Choose for flexibility and community support
- **CrewAI**: Choose for dedicated multi-agent workflows
- **OpenAI SDK**: Choose for quick OpenAI prototyping
- **Google ADK**: Choose for Google ecosystem integration

## Conclusion

Each framework has its strengths:
- Evaluate based on your specific requirements
- Consider ecosystem lock-in vs flexibility
- Think about long-term scalability needs
- Factor in team expertise and existing infrastructure
