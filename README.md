# AI Infrastructure Summit 2025 - Multi-Agent Systems

Repository containing presentation materials and demo code for the AI Infrastructure Summit 2025 session on designing multi-agent systems.

## Session Title: Designing Multi-Agent Systems: Challenges and Pitfalls

### Overview

This repository demonstrates the evolution from single LLM agents to sophisticated multi-agent systems, exploring different orchestration approaches, deployment strategies, and real-world implementation patterns.

### Key Topics Covered

1. **LLM Agent Fundamentals**
   - Task execution through reasoning, planning, and action
   - Observation and self-correction mechanisms
   - Goal-oriented problem solving

2. **Orchestration Approaches**
   - Higher orchestration (LangGraph, LinkedIn DragonSwarm)
   - Lower orchestration (Manus, A2A Protocol)
   - Declarative systems (N8N, Copilot Studio, OpenAI Agent SDK)

3. **Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns**
   - Hierarchical agent systems with meta-planning
   - Agent-to-Agent communication protocols
   - Context and memory management strategies

4. **Deployment Strategies**
   - Cloud vs Edge deployment considerations
   - Small Language Models (SLMs) for cost-effective agents
   - NVIDIA's research on efficient agent architectures

5. **Enterprise Implementation**
   - Governance and compliance frameworks
   - Scalability patterns and modular architecture
   - Real-world case studies (LinkedIn Hiring Assistant)

### Demo Code

The repository includes practical implementations demonstrating:

- **PSAgent**: PowerShell-based agent implementation
- **ToolCall**: Tool integration patterns for agents
- **SMS Integration**: Real-world tool usage example
- **Local AI Configuration**: Settings for on-device agent deployment
